# Node Compatibility

This library supports very old versions of node when importing and using the library. However, we do not support developing this library with very old versions of node.

Thats where this folder comes in. We will run the full test suite on a modern version of Node, but will check that the library still "works" with older versions of Node using this folder. You can run this file with your API key and if it succeeds, then your version of node is compatible. Otherwise, it is not.
