## v5.0.0 (2022-04-13)

### Breaking Changes

- Bumps the minimum version of Node to `v10`
- Removes build targets of `0.10`, `6`, and `8`, the library is now only published under a single bundled `easypost` package instead of separate bundled assets per version
- Bumps all dependencies to the most recent compatible versions that still support Node 10, the library is now buildable on Node 16+
- Removed `retrieveRates()` method because the shipment object already has rates. If you need to get new rates for a shipment, please use regenerateRates() method instead
- Removed `enable()` and `disable()` methods in the apiKey class. Please use this functionality through EasyPost website
- Removed the deprecated `options.useCookie` param. Please use `options.useProxy` instead
- Removed `add_shipment` and `remove_shipment` from the Batch object which could lead to confusion as the API documentation only describes adding/removing as an array. If you need to add or remove a single shipment from a batch, use the already existing `add_shipments` and `remove_shipments` and pass your single shipment into an array.
- The responses from the `/all` endpoints are no longer unwrapped and now properly follow the documentation where records will be wrapped in their respective object key
  - This now corrects the location of the `has_more` key which allows for pagination

### Features

- Adds support to one-call buy an order
- Adds the Nodejs version in use to the User-Agent header on requests
- Adds support to update the brand for a user
- Adds `retrieveMe()` convenience function that retrieves the authenticated user without the need to specify an ID
- Adds `address.verifyAddress()` and `Address.createAndVerify()` functions
- Adds `Batch.createAndBuy()` function
- Adds `Refund` class which has `Refund.save()`, `Refund.all()`, and `Refund.retrieve()` functions

### Bug Fixes

- Fixes `delivery_date` property typo on Rate object
- Fixes `customs_item.value` to be a `number` instead of a `string`
- Lowered the default timeout of requests from 120 seconds to 60 seconds

### Chores

- Removes `@easypost/build` and instead uses Webpack directly to build the project
  - The project is now only built for `node` and may not provide browser compatible code. If you require browser compatible Javascript, we suggest you build from source
- Adds `prettier` and formats the entire project
- Adds comprehensive test suite with Pollyjs covering every interface of the client library
- Adds jsdoc style info to each method

## v4.0.0 (2021-10-06)

- JSON encodes POST bodies instead of form encoding them by default
- Adds support for `tax_identifiers`

- Ran `npm audit fix` to bump patch versions of dependencies
