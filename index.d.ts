 * 
 * Insurance purchased through the Shipment Buy or Insure endpoints is immediately insured - there is no possibility of rejection based on tracking information, as the package was just created. 
 * On the other hand, Insurance purchased on shipments purchased outside of EasyPost requires creation with a tracking code so that EasyPost may confirm the package existence and current shipping status at the time of purchase.

 * Both kinds of Insurance use the Tracking system to receive periodic updates, and will report those updates to any appropriate Webhooks on file. 
 * Standalone insurance will cancel itself if the tracking information for the given tracking code shows evidence of having been shipped anytime before the insurance was purchased.
 * 
 * Unlike Shipments within EasyPost, Insurance objects register To and From Address objects according to the destination and ship-from locations of the package. 
 * This means that a Shipment with "is_return: true" actually ships to the listed From Address.

 * Each Tracker is continually updated in the background as the package moves through its life cycle, regardless of whether or not the label was purchased through EasyPost.
 * 
 * After creation, a Tracker object will be updated periodically based on when the carrier provides EasyPost with new tracking information. 
 * This information can be consumed by using our webhooks infrastructure.

 * 
 * The Tracker object contains both the current information about the package as well as previous updates. 
 * All of the previous updates are stored in the tracking_details array. 
 * Each TrackingDetail object contains the status, the message from the carrier, and a TrackingLocation.
 * 
 * The TrackingLocation contains city, state, country, and zip information about the location where the package was scanned. 
 * The information each carrier provides is different, so some carriers may not make use of all of these fields.

 * The CarrierDetail object contains the service and container_type of the package. 
 * Additionally, it also stores the est_delivery_date_local and est_delivery_time_local, which provide information about the local delivery time.

 * The carriers do eventually recycle tracking_codes, and for this reason enforcing uniqueness on the tracking_code field is not recommended.

 * The Webhook object provides CRUD operations for all Webhooks.
 * 
 * Currently, our recommended best practice for securing Webhooks involves using basic authentication and HTTPS on your endpoint. 
 * This will help prevent any altering of any information communicated to you by EasyPost, prevent any third parties from seeing your webhooks in transit, and will prevent any third parties from masquerading as EasyPost and sending fraudulent data. 
 * EasyPost performs certificate validation and requires any TLS-enabled (HTTPS) webhook recipients to have a certificate signed by a public trusted certification authority. 
 * We do not support sending webhooks to over SSLv2, SSLv3, or any connection using so-called export-grade ciphers. 
 * For documentation on how to set up your server with TLS, we recommend Mozilla's guide to Server-Side TLS and Qualys's SSL/TLS deployment best practices guide.
 * 
 * In general, a Webhook's endpoint should return a status code of 2XX. 
 * A 200 is preferred, but any 2XX status will indicate to our system that the Webhook request was successful. 
 * Endpoints that return a large volume and rate of failures over a period of time will get automatically disabled by the system; a disabled Webhook can be re-enabled using the Webhook update endpoint.
