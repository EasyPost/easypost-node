Installation
---------------

```
npm install --save @easypost/api
```

Note: if you are using a version of Node less than 6.9, you will need to install and
include a polyfill, such as `babel-polyfill`, and include it in your project:

```
npm install --save babel-polyfill
```

In your file:

```
require('babel-polyfill');
const EasyPost = require('@easypost/api');
```

To test out the API, you can run `npm install -g @easypost/api` and run
`easypost`.  you can also clone this repository, `npm install` to install
dependencies, `npm run build` to build the project, and run
`API_KEY=yourkey ./repl.js --local` to try out an interactive CLI.

Example
------------------

```javascript
const apiKey = 'cueqNZUb3ldeWTNX7MU3Mel8UXtaAMUi';
const EasyPost = require('@easypost/api');

const api = new EasyPost(apiKey);

// set addresses
const toAddress = new api.Address({
  name: 'Dr. Steve Brule',
  street1: '179 N Harbor Dr',
  city: 'Redondo Beach',
  state: 'CA',
  zip: '90277',
  country: 'US',
  phone: '310-808-5243'
});

const fromAddress = new api.Address({
  name: 'EasyPost',
  street1: '118 2nd Street',
  street2: '4th Floor',
  city: 'San Francisco',
  state: 'CA',
  zip: '94105',
  phone: '415-123-4567'
});

/* es5 with promises: */
fromAddress.save().then(addr => {
  console.log(addr.id);
});

/* es2017 with async/await: */
await fromAddress.save();
console.log(fromAddress.id);
```

Note: if you are using `es6`, you can use `import "@easypost/api/easypost"` to
avoid loading regenerator-runtime twice. We plan on supporting a node6+ version
at some point as well for native generator support.
