  /**
   * Depending on your use case an Address can be used in many different ways.
   * Certain carriers allow rating between two zip codes, but full addresses are required to purchase postage.
   * It is recommended to provide as much information as possible during creation and to reuse these objects whenever possible.
   *
   * Address objects can also be created inline while creating another object, for example during Shipment Creation.
   *
   * Verify an Address
   *  - Verifying an Address before you ship is a great way to reduce issues with delivery.
   *    Creating a verified Address is as simple as including an enumerated list of the verifications you'd like EasyPost to perform in the verify or verify_strict url parameters.
   *    If any of the verification checks included in the verify_strict list fail an error will be returned from the API.
   *    The example below demonstrates the most common verification: "delivery", which checks that the address is deliverable and sets its residential delivery indicator.
   *
   *  - The most effective time to perform address verification is when your customer, or the person entering the delivery address, is present.
   *    When designing a shopping cart it is recommended to ask the shopper for their address and verify it on the spot.
   *    If verification fails, ask them to double check their input; if they confirm that their data is correct, assume they know their address more correctly than the verification process.
