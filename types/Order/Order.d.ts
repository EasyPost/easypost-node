 * The Order object represents a collection of packages and can be used for Multi-Piece Shipments.

 * These Addresses will be copied to each Shipment so there is no need to specify them multiple times.
 * Each Shipment must then specify its Parcel, Options, and CustomsInfo.
 *
 * An Order created with valid Address Objects and Parcel data nested within the Order's Shipment object will automatically retrieve available shipping Rate options.
