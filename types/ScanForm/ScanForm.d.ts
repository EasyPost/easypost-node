/**
 * A ScanForm can be created to speed up and simplify the carrier pickup process.
 * The ScanForm is one document that can be scanned to mark all included tracking codes as "Accepted for Shipment" by the carrier.
 * The following criteria must met before creation:
 *  - Refunded Shipments cannot be added
 *  - Each Shipment must have the same origin address
 *  - Shipments must all be dated (using the label_date option) on or after the date the form is generated
 *  - Shipments cannot be added to more than one ScanForm
 *  - Existing ScanForms may not be updated with additional Shipments. If a ScanForm already exists, and new Shipments need to be added, a new ScanForm must be created.
 *  - Shipments should be provided in the form of an array
 *
